# About
concoction is a world building app where writers can log information about the world(s) that they are creating. A place where a writer can refer back to and add new information about that world.

## Technologies
1. Backend
  - Django
  - Python
  - PostgresSQL
2. Frontend
  - React
  - Javascript
  - Axios
  - CSS3/Bootstrap

## Challenges
1. I was my own obstacle. What an obstacle I was. The mental battle I had with myself was something else.
2. Before the challenge I faced with my mental state, I had thought Login Auth would be a challenge. Incorporating different model relationship with Django such specifically the many-to-many model relationship.
3. Another challenge was React Hooks and Functional components. I was not as familiar with react as much as I felt that I needed to be to be able to take on this app of mine.

### Features I would like to add
1. Login Auth
2. The Related Models
3. D3JS
4. Some UI Design like Models and/or a carousel.
5. A Third Party Api that would generate a writing motivational quote that might help with writer's block.

### Personal Purpose of this App
1. To Tackle Django because I don't feel as comfortable with the backend wireframe because I don't know all of the pages that has been added
2. To become more comfortable with React. I don't feel confident with my react skills prior to building this app.
3. To Learn React Hooks and Functional Components.
